			It's been a while since Slapped Silly Studios has been active on social media, but us three are still going strong!
			With a new website and a new appreciation for <a href="http://twitter.com/SlugSlasher" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and all it can do, we're starting to ramp up our efforts to get Slug Slasher out there and connect with the rest of the indie community.
			<br/><br/>
			
			In line with these efforts, we're starting up a Sunday Update series to show off some of the neat things we come up with and make each week.
			In these you'll be able to see behind the scenes into the development process and gain an insight into how we go about doing the things we do!
			<br/><br/>
			
			Check out what each of us has been up to below...

			These past few weeks have been interesting for us here at Slapped Silly Studios.
			With all three of us being full time students and officers of our university's <a href="http://hoosiergames.com" target="_blank">game development club</a>, work on Slug Slasher seemed to have stalled for a little bit.
			<br/><br/>
			
			To try and find something that would provide a source of some more motivation, we decided to overhaul the old website into the one you see now.
			This, as well as the completion of our first teaser trailer, helped solidify our work as something <em>legit</em> rather than another fleeting student project, giving a new sense of drive to continue working.
			<br/><br/>
			
			Moving on to the new developments of the past month or so, we're currently focused on designing and constructing the Arena, an area within the second level of the game.
			Contrasting the level's earlier deep, dark sewer/mine themed section, the Arena is a tonal departure to the glitzy, glamorous world of Slug Vegas.
			<br/>

			In keeping with the original idea of a battle arena, the area features an interesting combination of aesthetics from ancient Rome and modern entertainment hubs across the world.
			<br/><br/>
			
			<div class="img wide" style="background-image: url('posts/img/AutumnSketches.png');" caption="early sketches of characters and set pieces"></div>
			Additionally, we've recently acquired the help of Autumn Almeida, another IU student and a very talented artist.
			While she's only been making sketches for a couple days, she has already been a great help in establishing the mood of the Arena and creating more nonsensical, over-the-top ideas for various characters and other elements throughout the section.
			<br/><br/>
			
			This addition should hopefully free up some time for me to focus more on level construction and implementation of new mechanics, enemies, and bosses, rather than designing and drawing slugs for hours on end.

			Today I worked a bit on some new areas for our Arena section in level two.
			We recently changed how the Arena will flow, so I needed to create some new areas to match the new thematic setting.
			One of our goals was to incorporate more areas with the grappling hook, so I decided to start there.
			<br/>
			
			<div class="img wide" caption="swinging through the sewers" style="background-image: url('posts/img/GrappleSwing.gif');"></div>
			
			I knew from previous playtests that the grappling hook works very well with the bouncy slugs that we have, since the grappling hook can massively increase the players momentum, and then the bouncy slug will allow the player to retain that momentum and fly very quickly through an area. 
			But we already have an area that has both of these, so I decided to shake things up by actually putting a bouncy slug onto a moving platform, which was something we haven’t tried before.
			<br/>
			
			<div class="img wide" style="background-image: url('posts/img/BouncyOnPlatform.png');"></div>
			
			Although it looks very odd, it works fantastically, and even better, it’s incredibly fun to be zooming across a level while bouncing off of moving slugs. 
			This quickly led to the theming of this area as a sort of trapeze, Cirque Du Soleil type show, put on by the slugs.
			<br/><br/>
			
			Building on the high intensity, high speed, we decided to play around with the idea of Donkey Kong-esque cannons that fire the player out in a specific direction.
			After only a short time of experimenting with this idea, I was totally hooked. We quickly came up with new enemies&mdash;daredevil snails that fire themselves out of these same cannons, blocking the player and forcing them to quickly adjust themselves.
			<br/><br/>
			
			With these new enemies, the bouncy slugs, and the cannons, there’s a ton of room to build a huge, crisscrossing level. 
			I think the biggest issue I'm going to run into is spacing between the different platforms and objects. 
			During my own testing, sometimes I found myself flying at high speeds easily making jumps between platforms. 
			However, other times, if i was off by just a second or two, I found myself completely slow, falling into the endless oblivion of the Unity scene. 
			<br/><br/>
			
			This area in particular will be difficult to strike a balance between keeping the higher skilled players entertained, while not frustrating the lower skilled players.

			I spent a little time today getting some GIFs ready for Twitter.
			<br/>
			<div class="img wide" style="background-image: url('posts/img/SteamSlugs.gif');"></div>
			
			I recorded a little play through and looked for interesting moments, after which I took the recording into Adobe Premiere and cut out clips of those moments.
			Premiere does not seem to like exporting GIFs so I had to go through a bit of a tedious process of converting the clips to GIFs.
			<br/>
			<img class="img" src="posts/img/PremiereExport.png" style="height:auto" />
			I would export the clips as H.264s and used an <a href="https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif" target="_blank">online converter</a> to get them into GIFs.
			While I definitely don't think this is the most efficient way, it works for now. 
			Premiere does have some nice presets specifically for Twitter that make things pretty easy, which I tweaked a little bit, but nothing major.
