			Wow, another Sunday update post! 
			This one won't be quite as long as the last&mdash;<em>what with midterms and such messing with our development schedules</em>&mdash;but it should be pretty cool nonetheless!

			This week's efforts have been primarily focused on smoothing out the design and construction of the
			sewer / mine section of our second "level."
			<br/><br/>
			
			One of the weaker points of the first level, and something
			that we'll hopefully be able to fix with a later pass, is the lack of a strong sense of place.
			The city areas tend to blend together without much development as the player progresses through.
			<br/>

			With these issues in mind, I've been trying to create more distinct visual landmarks to help areas feel more unique and memorable,
			even if it's just within the context of the sewer itself. Interesting pipe formations and small details foreshadowing the later,
			more thematically dense sections of the game will hopefully impart a better sense of the slugs' world and story.
			<br/><br/>
			
			While there isn't too much to show in game, we've been doing a lot of work ironing out 
			the design of the new areas within the arena section that we introduced <a href="http://slugslasher.com/post?March4Update" target="_blank">last week.</a>
			With cannons, aerial combat, and giant drums and hammers we're excited to start putting something 
			together that is truly memorable on both a thematic and mechanical level.

				Making a Mechanic Fun and Engaging
			</strong>
			<br /><br/>
			
			Another recent development has been the rethinking of the grapple mechanic introduced in the
			first part of the sewer section. A planned feature from the very beginning, we'd all started to become
			weary of the ability's shortcomings, both technically and from the lens of player enjoyment.
			<br/>
			
			<div class="img wide" caption="the original swinging motion of the grapple" style="background-image: url('posts/img/GrappleSwing.gif');"></div>
			
			While we liked the ability to smoothly carry horizontal momentum and build up speed by chaining successive swings,
			we'd found that the timing window to do this successfully was simply a bit too unforgiving for such a simple mechanic.
			Players would routinely find themselves running into walls and falling short of jumps, creating an experience of intense 
			extremes&mdash;when the grapple worked it felt great, but when it didn't the flow of the game came to an awkward, grinding halt.
			<br/><br/>
			
			At a loss for how to make the system more fun and engaging without redesigning all the areas that rely on it, we turned to other
			examples of grappling mechanics in 2D platformers to see how the problem was solved there.
			<br/>

			<a href="http://flinthook.com/" target="_blank">Flinthook,</a> a game whose central movement ability is a quick, satisfying hook pull,
			proved to be an invaluable point of reference for making something that was both engaging and compatible with our existing level designs.
			<br/><br/>
			
			The short boost from the player's position to the grapple anchor proved to be a great answer to fixing the cumbersome, unpredictable movement
			offered by our original swinging motion while not sacrificing the ability to smoothly fly through an area when executed with good timing.
			<br/>
			
			<div class="img wide" caption="pulling motion with a prototype of the new system" style="background-image: url('posts/img/GrapplePull.gif');"></div>
			
			This solution also opens the door for more verticality when designing grapple-centric environments, which before could hardly be anything
			other than completely flat without mixing in additional movement options.
